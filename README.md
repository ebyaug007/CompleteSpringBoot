Representation models
The ResourceSupport/Resource/Resources/PagedResources group of classes never really felt appropriately named. After all, these types do not actually manifest resources but rather representation models that can be enriched with hypermedia information and affordances. Hereâ€™s how new names map to the old ones:

ResourceSupport is now RepresentationModel

Resource is now EntityModel

Resources is now CollectionModel

PagedResources is now PagedModel

ControllerLinkBuilder is now WebMvcLinkBuilder

For actuator refer the below link


https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-endpoints


You can make use of basic endpoint just by adding actuator dependency. For additional ones add the necessary properties in application.properities

For reference of Spring boot Admin refer the below link

https://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/

Steps
	1. Add dependency starter-client

	2. Add 2 spring.boot.admin properties in application.properties

		#Point to Admin Server
		spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:9080
		#using the metadata
		spring.boot.admin.client.instance.metadata.tags.environment=dev


Create a seperate project for running springboot admin (here running in 9080 port server.port=9080)
	1. Add dependency starter-server
	2. Annotate SpringbootApplication class with EnableAdminServer


Start both these projects and access http://localhost:9080/
